# Blocking Index 2d
 Program with the intent to detect **Atmospheric Blocking structures**

This implementation is an addaptation of the algorith presented in [Barnes et al., (2012)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00382-011-1243-6), to detect atmospheric blockings structure in two fields, **Potential Temperature at Dynamical Tropopause**, [Pelly & Hoskins, (2012)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/60/5/1520-0469_2003_060_0743_anpob_2.0.co_2.xml), [Berrisford et al., (2007)](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atsc/64/8/jas3984.1.xml) and **Geopotential Height in the Middle Troposphere**, [Tibaldi & Molteni, (1990)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1034/j.1600-0870.1990.t01-2-00003.x).
